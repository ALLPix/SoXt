This is a list of issues that needs to be investigated and fixed.  The
number is just the chronologic numeric id, and has no bearing on what
priority the item has.

001 With SoXt, when doing a deco on/off, I get a bad size on my views.
    Mainly the decoartion size is badly taken into account at the level
    of the GL widget.

    In the join .diff file I propose to fix that by introducing a
    resizeCB on the GLWidget that will take into account the needed
    corrections to handle decoration size on this widget.

    [patches was attached]

    Update 20030204 larsa:

    The proposed solution needs at least /some/ reworking to not drag
    Widget-specific stuff into the public API of the generic components.

002 When I have a program that creates a SoGtkExaminerViewer or an
    SoXtExaminerViewer; by default the viewer is in viewing mode (which
    is ok) but the cursor is in picking mode!

003 Assertion failed: visual != (Visual *) NULL && colormap != 0, file
    SoXtThumbWheel.cpp, line 455 (when running under Uim/X)

004 "Dark Screen" e.g. the colors are all wrong, very dark, can't see
    any menu items or popup text

005 Porting Coin/SoXt to work with NuTCracker from MKS.  NuTCracker
    is pretty similar to cygwin but I'm not sure of all the differences.
    We are having problems running the config scripts because they
    recognize the system as Windows-based instead of Unix-based, like
    a cygwin system would.  However, NuTCracker uses Visual C++ and
    Absoft Fortran for compilers, not gcc.

006 The SoXtColorEditor is missing.

    This widget is part of the SoXtMaterialEditor.  It was made public
    in TGS Inventor 3.0, reportedly.

007 The SoXtMAterialEditor is missing

    Assuming people are interested in this one too.

008 The class hierarchy doesn't match the original SGI hierarchy in the
    protected: sections of different classes.

009 On HP-UX, configure misses the presence of gl.h.  The file is
    located at /opt/graphics/OpenGL/include/GL/gl.h.  The gl.h in
    src/Inventor/Xt/common fails.  Defining HAVE_GL_GL_H (of course)
    fixes this problem.

    Reported by Mark Anderson

========================================================================

010 Something in the configure script messes up and uses
    @SOQT_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS@, @SOQT_VERSION@, etc. instead of the SoXt
    versions, so that I have to manually go in and edit each Makefile
    to use the correct cppflags, cxxflags, etc.

011 Even though the Xmu check failed, the functions using Xmu still get
    written (e.g. in SoXt.cpp).  I don't have a version of Xmu compiled
    with X11R6 so I have not been able to get everything to compile
    correctly (it is somehow mixing R5, which I have Xmu compiled for,
    with R6, which is where /usr/include/X11 is pointing to).

    Reported by Mark Anderson

========================================================================

012 Finally, I'm having problems now with the Xmu library.  On HP, it's
    installed in a non-standard location (/usr/contrib/X11R6) and I have
    to hack my way through the code (by forcing HAVE_LIBXMU to be
    defined) to get it to compile.

013 Something is fishy with how the default visual, colormap and depth
    are picked out (SoXtInternal, SoXtThumbWheel) - cause X errors on
    IRIX.

014 SoXtComponent::setFullScreen() does not work

    Code that works for non-realized widgets was submitted, but not
    code that can toggle already opened windows.

015 New windows pop up in the top-left corner at coordinate (0,0),
    while for the other toolkits, they pop up centered.  This is with
    the larswm window manager - don't know if this is a problem with
    any other wm.  Nevertheless, it clearly indicates that something
    is non-standard with the initial window attributes.
