Spaceball/Joystick support in SoXt
==================================

Currently, spaceballs and joysticks are only supported through the
Linux Joystick Driver.  This means that they are only supported on
Linux architectures at the moment.  Support through the more generic
X Input device extension will follow shortly.

When a spaceball or a joystick is used with SoXt, SoEvent objects of
the type SoMotion3Event and SoSpaceballButtonEvent types are sent
into the scene graph.  These events do not cause any changes to the
scene by default, but the events can be picked up by the user by
using an SoEventCallback node or deriving a dragger and calling the
getEvent() method.

The Linux Joystick Driver
=========================

Information on the Linux Joystick Driver project can be found on the
project home page at <URL:http://www.suse.cz/development/joystick/>.

SoXt/configure has the following options related to Spaceball/Joystick
support:

  --with-linux-joystick / --without-linux-joystick

    This option enables/disables default SoXt support for the Linux
    Joystick Driver.  Linux Joystick Driver support is enabled by
    default on systems where the <linux/joystick.h> include file can
    be found.

  --with-linux-joystick-device=/dev/js0

    In case the Linux Joystick device isn't located at /dev/js0, this
    option can be used to configure what the default joystick device
    should be.  The default setting can be overrided with the environment
    variable SOXT_JOYSTICK_DEVICE.
