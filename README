SoXt is an open source implementation of the SGI InventorXt library, which
is a GUI binding for using Open Inventor with Xt/Motif.  While SoXt has
been developed for use with Coin, it is also possible to compile it against
Open Inventor from SGI or TGS.  A goal is to eventually become 100% source
code compatible with the InventorXt library, which is still way off,
especially when it comes to creating derived classes.

When using SoXt, bear in mind that SoXt is in its alpha release phase,
so expect the worst...


INSTALLATION
============

Installing SoXt is a matter of running the configure script with the right
options, getting it to pass all its tests, and run "make install" afterwards.
These two phases has each a set of common problems which will be gathered
and described below.


The Configure Phase (running SoXt/configure)
--------------------------------------------

The file INSTALL contains generic information about running the configure
script.  It's a good idea to have read that file one time or another, but
it's the same file as in every other autoconf-based project and this one
contains no extra information.  Anyways, here are some common problems:

* configure immediately tells you it can't find the source files

  My guess is that you are trying to run configure from a separate build
  directory, and you have started SoXt/configure with a relative pathname
  that traverses some symbolic link.  Configure doesn't handle that, so
  you can either cd into your build directory using the hard path, or you
  can use the absolute pathname for SoXt/configure

* configure doesn't find Coin (or coin-config)

  To detect Coin, configure looks for the script called coin-config, which
  is installed in bin/ where you installed Coin.  You do probably not have
  that bin-directory in your PATH variable, so configure won't find where
  it is.  The solution is to either add {Coin-prefix}/bin to $PATH, or you
  can run SoXt/configure with the "--with-coin={Coin-prefix}" option.


The Build Phase
---------------

* compilation fails because the _source_ file isn't found by the compiler

  Weird - I thought this problem was fixed.  Anyways, it's your make
  program's fault.  It uses $VPATH to find the source files, but doesn't
  prefix the file path when a rule uses $<.  You have three options.
  You can install GNU make (gmake on some systems) and use that instead of
  your system's faulty make.  You can also build the library in the
  source directory instead of in a separate directory.  A third solution
  is to use "lndir" to create a duplicate directory structure with symlinks
  to all the files in the source directory, and run configure and make in
  the duplicate instead.  Be aware that lndir might fail to work if you
  don't write absolute path-names for both of its arguments.

* compilation fail because SoXtBasic.h.in can't be created

  You don't have write permission in the source directory.  This will be
  fixed in the future.  In the mean time, copy the source hierarchy to
  somewhere you have write access before building.
