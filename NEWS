This file contains a history log of user-visible changes in the SoXt
library.

* 2000-09-21 larsa:

	Public license change from QPL to GNU LGPL.

* 2000-06-26 larsa:

	SoXt has now support for the Linux Joystick driver, which means
	you can connect e.g. a Spaceball 4000 FLX to your serial port
	and get Motion3/SpaceballButton events sent into the scene graph.
	See http://www.suse.cz/development/joystick/ for information on
	the driver.

* 2000-05-22 larsa:

	SoXt no longer uses the GLw/GLwM widget from SGI / Mesa, but
	uses it's own integrated SoXtGLArea widget based on the SGI
	sources.  Maybe not an improvement for those who have the GL
	widget installed, but one obstacle less when installing SoXt
	for those who haven't.
